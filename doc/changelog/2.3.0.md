# 2.3.0

* Greatly simply the DomZipper base abstractions
* Revise the JS DomZipper:
  * The `{,Html}DomZipper{,At,Root}` set of types have all been replaced by a single, simple `DomZipperJs`
  * You no longer specify the DOM type of the focus and children at the zipper level,
    but as you extract the DOM
    (eg. instead of `.asHtml.dom` use `.domAsHtml`)
* Add a `dom-zipper-jsoup` module to use with in-memory HTML in the JVM
* Add a `DomZipperPair` for fusing two different zippers over identical content;
  one as a slow source-of-truth zipper with real DOM,
  and another as a fast inspection-only zipper.
* Added to DomZippers to ensure that DOM doesn't change in the middle of an observation:
  * `def startConsistencyCheck(): () => F[Unit]`
  * `def ensureConsistency[A](f: this.type => A): F[A]`
* Add `FastDomZipperSelenium` as a Jsoup-backed fast alternative to using Selenium for observation.

* TODO UPDATE DOCS!
