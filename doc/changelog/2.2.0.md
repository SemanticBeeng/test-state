# 2.2.0

This release is huge; loads of new functionality!

#### Selenium support

TestState now supports Selenium.
AFAIK this makes it the only FP option for Selenium-based test automation.

* Add a Selenium module including:
  * multiple tab support
  * multiple browser (instance) support
  * parallelism and concurrency -
    according to settings, spreads load across a browser pool and multiple tabs in each browser
  * extension methods to Selenium classes:
    * `WebDriver`
    * `WebElement`
    * `Point`
* Add a Selenium-based DomZipper.

#### Retry functionality

Tests can now have automatic retry on errors and failures.
Use `.withRetryPolicy` on `Test{,WithInitialState}` and `RunnableTest` to add
retry capabilities to your test; there are a number of predefined retry policies
available from `Retry.Policy`.

Use this with Selenium tests to avoid the need for sleeps and wait;
no need to consider asynchronicity at all.

#### New Functionality

* Add Focus DSL for `Option`s.
* Add a cross-compiled `DomZipperModule`.
* Add to `DomZipper`
  * `getAttribute(name): Option[String]`
  * `needAttribute(name): String`
  * `child(css?, m of n?)`
  * `.children01` & `.children01(css)`
  * `.children0n` & `.children0n(css)`
  * `.children1n` & `.children1n(css)`
  * `.classes: Set[String]`
  * `.exists(css, filter): Boolean`
  * `.matches(css): Boolean`
* Add to `DomZipper.collect` results
  * `.filter`
* Add `Attempt.toStringWithStackTrace`
* Add to `Report`
  * `print` to print the report to stdout
  * `exception` to get an exception that best describes the test failure
* Add more DSL useful for observation partiality; see [`StdlibUtil.scala`](https://github.com/japgolly/test-state/blob/master/core/shared/src/main/scala/teststate/dsl/StdlibUtil.scala)

#### New Behaviour

* Multiple threads printing reports at the same time no longer interleave on the screen
* Report format
  * multi-line failure messages now supported
  * failure detail can be highlighted differently than the failed test step
  * by default, failure detail is now dark red (where as it used to be bright red)
  * when collection equality fails, the results now span two lines with the output aligned
* Tweak equality assertion failure message.
* {In,de}crease assertions are now clearer in reports.

#### Bugfixes

* Calling `.updateState` on a group of actions should run after all actions, not on each inner action.
* Calling `.updateState` on an empty action turn it into a non-empty action (rather than discarding the state update)
* Coloured reports now display as intended on OS X

#### API Changes

* In `TestWithInitialState`:
  * `.run` is now deprecated - use one of the following
  * Added `.withRef(ref: R)`
  * Added `.withRefByName(ref: => R)`
  * Added `.withLazyRef(ref: => R)`
  * Added `.withoutRef(implicit ev: Unit =:= R)`
* Deprecate `.mapZippers` in DomZipper collection; use `.map` instead
* Deprecate `Report#assertF()`; use `Report#assert(useFailSettingsOnPass = true)` instead
* Deprecate `Report#formatF()`; use `Report#format(useFailSettingsOnPass = true)` instead
* `ROS` (ref-obs-state) is now a subtype of `OS` (obs-state)
* Rename `Recover[E]` typeclass to `ErrorHandler[E]`

#### Dependency upgrades

* Upgrade Cats        to 1.1.0
* Upgrade Scala       to 2.12.6
* Upgrade Scalaz      to 7.2.25
* Upgrade ScalaJs DOM to 0.9.6
* Upgrade Scala.JS    to 0.6.24
